# MESuSiE Analysis Reproduce
This is a site to hold all analysis code and link to the data downloading of MESuSiE analysis. MESuSiE is a package for multiple-ancestry fine-mapping, which can be found [here](https://github.com/borangao/MESuSiE). All the real and simulation data used in the scripts can be found in the [data directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hgzCXntiMVUtlOaHPeJP3TqMRbnGdOUj), which is publicly available. \\
The processed summary statistics is in the real_data/sumstat.RData, the fine-mapping results for MESuSiE, SuSiE, Paintor, and functional annotaiton information of the SNPs can be found real_data/res_all.RData. The two real data example in the manuscript can be found in real_data/HDL_APOE.RData and real_data/TC_ARI4C.RData. All the figures for the real data can be reproduced with the code summarizing.R
