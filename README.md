# MESuSiE Analysis Reproduce
This is a site to hold all analysis code and link to the data downloading of MESuSiE analysis. MESuSiE is a package for multiple-ancestry fine-mapping, which can be found [here](https://github.com/borangao/MESuSiE). All the real and simulation data used in the scripts can be found in the [data directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hgzCXntiMVUtlOaHPeJP3TqMRbnGdOUj), which will be publicly available soon.
